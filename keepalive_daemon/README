COMPILE

  gcc -O2 -Wall -Wextra -lsocket -o keepalive_daemon *c

USAGE

  run as master listening on port 23454:
    ./keepalive_daemon -m 23454

  run as slave:
    ./keepalive_daemon -s 'exec sleep 5' 192.168.0.1 23454

NOTES

  Under QNX, the child has to trap SIGTERM, because the default behavior
  of direct child is to resends the signal to its parent, thus
  effectively terminating this daemon!

TODO

  reimplement timers (to support longer waiting time than the dispatch frequency)
  send the UDP packet 3x at once (both request & reply)
  run it with nice -n-255
